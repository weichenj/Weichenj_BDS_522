#Reserach Question #3
#Lastly, I want to know heart attack acna be predicted using sleep time and smoking and blood pressure. I want to use logistic regression to predict this.

#So we have to see those follow elements: 
#Cvdinfr4 : ever disgonised with heart attack
#Toldhi2 :ever told blood cholesterol high
#Bphgh4: ever told bllod pressure high
#Spletm1:how many hour do you sleep
#Smoke100: ever smoke within the last 100 days

```{r}
Q3 <- names(brfss2013) %in% c("cvdinfr4","smoke100","toldhi2", "bphigh4", "sleptim1")
subdata <- brfss2013[Q3]
subdata$cvdinfr4 <- replace(subdata$cvdinfr4, which(is.na(subdata$cvdinfr4)), "No")

#Make sure that No NA index in our data, so that we have better significance
summary(subdata$cvdinfr4)

#Treat those NA’s into No for smoker, so that I have better conclusion in the end.
subdata$smoke100 <- replace(subdata$smoke100,which(is.na(subdata$smoke100)),"No")
summary(subdata$smoke100)
  
#Treat those NA’s into No for smoker, so that I have better conclusion in the end.
subdata$smoke100 <- replace(subdata$smoke100,which(is.na(subdata$smoke100)),"No")

#Now I want to treat the NA to be the No, so that it is easier for me to conclude later. We
subdata$toldhi2 <- replace(subdata$toldhi2, which(is.na(subdata$toldhi2)), "No")
summary(subdata$toldhi2)

#Look at HIGH blood Pressure Data
table(subdata$bphigh4)
#I have to make sure that female told only during pregnancy to Yes, and told borderline or pre-hypertensive to Yes. In order to make sure logistic regression.
subdata1 <- subdata
subdata1$bphigh4 <- as.factor(ifelse(subdata1$bphigh4=="Yes", "Yes", (ifelse(subdata1$bphigh4=="Yes, but female told only during pregnancy", "Yes",(ifelse(subdata1$bphigh4=="Told borderline or pre-hypertensive", "Yes", "No"))))))
table(subdata1$bphigh4)

#Now we have better data:
table(subdata1$bphigh4)

Q3 <- glm(subdata1$cvdinfr4 ~ subdata1$sleptim1+subdata1$bphigh4+subdata1$smoke100+subdata1$toldhi2, data=subdata1, family = "binomial")
summary(Q3)

#Odds of Heart Attack = e^2.713xe^(-0.0004Sleeptime)xe^(-2.21Highbloodpressure)xe^(0.6853NotSmooking)xe^(0.8988NothighbloodCholestero)
#It is pretty clear that high blood pressure and smoking and blood cholesterol high are statistically significant when we predict the heart attack, 
#Intercept mean that when a person doesn’t sleep, not high blood pressure, not smoking, not high cholesterol, the odd ratio of have heart attack is e^2.713
#the odds ratio of having a heart attack for people with high blood pressure is 0.32
#the odds ratio of having a heart attack for people who smoking in the last 100 days is 15.07
#the odds ratio of having a heart attack for people who have high cholesterol is 2.457
#What makes me confused is that sleep time does affect the heart attack that much in this data set which is contradict with what people usually think.
